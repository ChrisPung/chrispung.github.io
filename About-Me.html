            I am Christopher Pung, a senior electrical and computer engineering student at
            The University of Texas at Austin. I am specializing in software engineering.
            <br>
            I like to update my website and learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
            I also like to learn and work on personal projects and am seeking to 
            maybe involve myself in an open source project that I find interesting.
            <br>
            Some things I do in my spare time are reading, learning, and some gaming.
